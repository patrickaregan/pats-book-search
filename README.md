# Pat's Book Search

## Description

  - This project is an application using the MERN stack that allows users to search for books and save information about the ones they like.
  - I wanted to build an application useing the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express, React and Node.
  - This is the most comprehensive project I have built yet. It is a full stack application where I have built the back end and the front end. It is the culmination of everything I have been learning in my coding bootcamp.
  - This project let's users login and search for books then save those books on a page so they can look at them later. This is helpful if you are busy and just want to bookmark a book so you can remember it later.
  - I learned the MERN stack. I also learnd GraphQL and how to use Apollo server and client. GraphQL is new and difficult to master but I can see it's power and flexibility.
